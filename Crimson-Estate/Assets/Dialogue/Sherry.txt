	Waiter, get me another glass of wine! This whole situation is a total mess, it's giving me a headache.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	(I think it's something else that's giving you the headache.) Hello there, and you are?
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	I'm Sherry, Barbara's sister. I suppose you want to question me about this whole ordeal?
	Say, you're a wizard, aren't you? Do you think I would be able to use magic?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I doubt it. You'd have to go through a lot of training to refine it.
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	Oh, that's too bad. And I would have loved to be able to turn blood into wine.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Keep that up, and you'll be getting that wish sooner than you think.
	(Blood into wine?)
	/GiveIdea metSherry
	(That's an interesting way to put it.)
	/Introduced
	(Maybe I should look into this more.)

metMaria {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Did you know anything about the victim, Maria?
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	I do! She was the worst. She always cut me off, even when I was totally fine! Can you believe the nerve? I won't miss her.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	A little cruel, don't you think?
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	She was the cruel one.

metCasey {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	How's your relationship with Casey?
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	I know she's my niece and all, but that girl is ghastly! I've seen her room once, and it nearly made me faint!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	You sure it was the room and not your wine?

metEddie {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Any thoughts on Eddie?
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	Who is that?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Eddie is Casey's boyfriend.
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	Oh, I thought his name was Bennie! That boy is so pale, you know. He really needs to go out and get some sun.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Helpful as always.

fiveOClock {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So Sherry, I found this and I thought I would give it to you since you've been so helpful.
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	Dennis, you just became my new favorite person!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Dresden. And I can't say that's a title I'm happy about.

tornPages {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Sherry, I found these pages with arcane writing on them. Do they mean anything to you?
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	I have no idea what you're talking about, wizard.

roseAlchemy {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Sherry, what were you doing with pages from a necromancy tome?
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	Oh relax. I was bored so I decided to rummage through Casey's room.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Isn't that an invasion of privacy?
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	And what have you been doing?
	Anyway, I pulled out a creepy book and looked through it, and bam! The thing said you could turn blood into wine. So I ripped it out in case it came in handy later.

	/SwitchTo Sherry
	What? No, I don't know what that's about. Let a girl drink in peace, okay?

filler {
	/SwitchTo Sherry
	Would you like to have a drink?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I'll pass. I know better than to get in the way of a woman and her glass of wine.
