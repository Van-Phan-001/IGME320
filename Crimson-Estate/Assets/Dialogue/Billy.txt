	Oh my gosh, are you Harry Dresden? I'm Billy! I've heard about you! You're so cool I can't believe I'm meeting you in person!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Haha, it's always nice to meet a fan. Tell me, have you seen anything suspicious going on recently?
	/SwitchTo Billy
	Nothing but a super lame party. Mom said something bad happened and that I can't use the bathroom anymore, but that's okay now that you're here!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Alright, I'll see you around, kiddo.
	/SwitchTo Billy
	Okay!
	/Introduced
	Bye!

	Hey Billy, did you know Maria well?
	/SwitchTo Billy
	I did! She was super nice. Sometimes I'd help her and my Mom bake stuff and we'd have soooo much fun!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	That's awesome Billy!
	/SwitchTo Billy
	Yup! Hey, I wonder when she'll be coming over.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	...
	I'm afraid she's going to be gone for a while. She's been... moved elsewhere.
	/SwitchTo Billy
	Oh, that's too bad.

	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So Billy, can you tell me anything about your sister?
	/SwitchTo Billy
	She's really scary! And mean! She never lets me go on her side of the room.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	That is pretty mean of her.
	/SwitchTo Billy
	Yeah, I'm just glad she's been in her room all night.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Thanks, Billy.
	/SwitchTo Billy
	Anything for you!

	Ahahaha! It would be reeeeeally cool if I did it!
