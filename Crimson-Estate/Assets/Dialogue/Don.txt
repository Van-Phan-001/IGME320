introduction {
	/SwitchTo Don
	Thank you for coming. Just like the L train, you have arrived swiftly. 
	My name is Donald Jameson Bartholomew, but you can call me Don.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	It is a pleasure to meet you, Don. Now, have you seen anything suspicious leading up to the maid's death?
	/SwitchTo Don
	I haven't observed anything too dubious, but the state of the body is certainly something to stay cognizant of.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Thank you.
	/Suggest Check_Maria's_body_in_the_upstairs_bathroom
	I'll be sure to stay mindfully aware of those transgressions.
	/Introduced
	I'll let you know when there are new updates.

metMaria {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	What can you tell me about Maria?
	/SwitchTo Don
	Honestly, she was quite the debauched character. She always seemed as though she were up to no good.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Interesting. 
	/GiveIdea rockyRelationship
	I will keep that noted.
}

conflictingRelationships {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So I spoke with Barbara, and it seems like she really liked Maria.
	/SwitchTo Don
	Alright, and?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Well, I was wondering why you had such a different opinion than her.
	/SwitchTo Don
	...
	Honestly, I've never said this aloud but...
	...
	I fear that Barbara may have been unfaithful to me with Maria.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	What makes you think that?
	/SwitchTo Don
	The two of them were always so close. I feared that Barbara would leave me for Maria, taking enough wealth with her to establish a new, extravagant life.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I'm sorry to hear that.
	/GiveIdea crimsonLetter
	But that certainly isn't a possibility anymore, I suppose.

needleTool {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Hey Don, I found this interesting object in your train room and I was wondering if you can tell me more about it.
	/SwitchTo Don
	Of course my dear detective! I use that tool to paint fine details onto my beloved trains. 
	Its thinness allows for precise strokes that I otherwise would not be able to achieve!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Sounds useful.
	/SwitchTo Don
	It has been imported all the way from Brazil.
	/UpdateIdea needleTool
	It is of the highest quality.
}

scarletSplatters {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Don, why are there splatters of a red liquid covering your train room?
	/SwitchTo Don
	Oh that is quite simple, really. In anticipation of these festivities, I was spending some time in solitude painting my lovely model trains. 
	Unfortunately, I jounced my desk and foolishly spilled some paint.
	/UpdateIdea scarletSplatters
	Even more unfortunately, I did not have enough time to unsully my workspace prior to the guests' arrivals.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Wow, that really sounds like quite the mishap.
	/SwitchTo Don
	Indubitably.
}

metCasey {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So Casey is your daughter, right?
	/SwitchTo Don
	Indeed she is. The lass is the pride of my heart.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Why is she so... grim?
	/SwitchTo Don
	My dear has always been fascinated with the macabre, but I'm sure it's just a phase.
	/Suggest Check_Casey's_room
	You should see her room! It is quite a sinister sight.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Thanks for the tip.
}

metEddie {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	How do you feel about Eddie?
	/SwitchTo Don
	Why, Eddie is a fine young man. He is quite chivalrous with my daughter and is ever so polite around the rest of the family. 
	In fact, he always waits at the door to be let in! What a spectacular display of manners!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Wow, he sounds too good to be true.

badEvidence {
	/SwitchTo Don
	Sorry, I don't believe I'll be able to help you with that. Best of luck to you, though.
}

filler {
	/SwitchTo Don
	Any new updates?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I'm working on it.
