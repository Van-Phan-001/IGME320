introduction {
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Mr. Dresden, I presume? Welcome to our estate! 
	Maria, come bring over some cinnamon rolls for this gentleman! ...Oh, that's right...
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I'm sorry for your loss. Can you tell me anything about what happened?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	I'm afraid not. I was busy getting pastries ready for the party guests. 
	When I called for her earlier, she didn't come, and that's when one of the servants told me what happened.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I see. 
	/Introduced
	Well, if anything else comes to mind, let me know.

metMaria {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Can you tell me anything about Maria?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Indeed... she was such a sweet soul. She would always assist me in the kitchen.
	Sometimes we'd even have Billy come cook with us! 
	Honestly, I'd probably consider her one of my closest friends. I'm going to miss her dearly...
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	That sounds like it was wonderful. I'm so sorry for your loss.
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Thank you, Mr. Dresden.
	/GiveIdea friendlyRelationship
	It really was wonderful.

metCasey {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So your daughter is quite... interesting.
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Yes, she certainly has her quirks. I just wish she'd come out and talk to us more. 
	She has been holed up in her room all night!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Maybe she'll come out eventually.
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	I do hope so, Mr. Dresden.
}

metEddie {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	What do you think about Casey's boyfriend?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Do you mean Eddie? That boy is delightful! 
	He's always so eager to try my new recipes, even when I use the most outlandish blood!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Interesting.
}

metSherry {
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Oh, it looks like you've met my sister.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Indeed. She's rather enthusiastic about wine, isn't she?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	She's much more agreeable when she's sober, you know, though she typically has more alcohol than blood in her. 
	Oh! Speaking of blood, I still need to go prepare my pastries. 
	This is an important batch, they have a rather... exotic origin.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	("Speaking of blood"? Surely she doesn't mean...)
	/Suggest Check_the_kitchen_pantry?
	(...Well, I guess I should go check that out at some point.)
}

bagsOfBlood {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I was looking around the kitchen and noticed there were some bags of blood.
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Oh, we use those for cooking!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Cooking? With blood?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Yes. It isn't too strange, is it? I use blood all of the time to make food. 
	Have you never heard of blood sausages? They're quite delicious.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Well, anyway, one of the bags was unmarked. Do you know what might be in that one?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Oh! Sorry, but I'm afraid I can't really tell you about those. 
	I'm sure it would be terrible if someone were to find out what I was doing.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	And what, exactly, would be so terrible about someone finding out?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	You heard me?!
	/UpdateIdea bagsOfBlood
	Please, just forget what I just said.

spendingHabits {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So, I understand you've been throwing a lot of money around.
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Me? Well, I've been spending a little in secret. 
	You know, there are some very unique types of animal blood out there.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Not spending too much, I hope?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Well, I may have gotten some yak's blood from the East. 
	Only cost a couple hundred thousand dollars, you know. 
	But please, don't tell Don about all this.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Rich people, huh. You know, this isn't really my problem to solve. 
	Good to know everything has been cleared up, though.
}

conflictingRelationships {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So I talked to Don, and it seems like him and Maria didn't really get along.
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Yes. It was always such a shame. He was always at her throat but I never knew why.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I'm sure that put some strain on your relationship.
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Indeed it did. I just hope he doesn't stay bitter now that she's gone.
}

crimsonLetter {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Don tells me that you may have been unfaithful to him with Maria. Is this true?
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	What? Of course not! I love Don with all my heart. 
	Sure, Maria is certainly tempting, but I would never do anything to jeopardize the family I love so much!
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Sorry, I didn't mean to accuse you of anything.
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	It's quite alright, I suppose.
}

badEvidence {
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Oh! I don't suppose I've seen anything like that around here. I'm afraid I don't know what that is.
}

filler {
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Mr. Dresden! Would you like a cream puff? Maria, bring over some... oh dear, that's right, she's...
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	(I feel a bit sorry for her, but she isn't the sharpest knife in the drawer, is she?)
}
crimsonAccusation {
	/SwitchTo Barbara
	Me? Kill Maria? She meant so much to me...
	You know what? Get out. Now. I can't believe you would say such a thing...
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Ah, damn it...
