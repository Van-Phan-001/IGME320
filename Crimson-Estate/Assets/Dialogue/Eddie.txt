	Hey dude. The name's Eddie, what's up?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Nice to meet you, Eddie.
	/GiveIdea metEddie
	I've been sent here to investigate a suspicious death.
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	Oh really? That sucks.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So would you happen to know anything about that?
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	Not really bro. I've kind of just been hanging with my girl Casey this whole time.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Alright, I'll probably come back to ask more questions later.
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	Works for me.
	/Introduced
	See ya round, dude.

metMaria {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So how well did you know Maria?
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	Who?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	The maid. She died tonight.
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	Oh dip. Sorry dude, but I barely knew her. I'm only really ever here to hang out with Casey and I don't really talk to the maid. She did seem kinda unsavory though.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Alright.

metCasey {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	What's the deal with Casey?
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	Oh, Casey's my girlfriend, dude.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I know, but why is she so... dark?
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	I dunno, but it's hot.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	To each their own, I suppose. Personally, I'm not really into the demonic kind.

	Where did you get a tome of necromancy from? And why did you give it to Casey?
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	Woah chillax bro, don't be so batty. I found this book at an old library, and I thought Casey would be interested in it.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	There is no way you found this in just some library.
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	I dunno what to tell you dude, it's where I got it.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	(Sigh)
	/UpdateIdea necromancyTome
	Anyway, why did you think Casey would be interested in it?
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	She's really into creepy stuff like that.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Thanks, I guess.
	/SwitchTo Eddie
	Anytime, bro.
