introduction {
	/SwitchTo Casey
	Huh? Oh, I'm Casey. Did you need something?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Yes, in fact, I do. I am investigating a murder and was wondering if you've seen anything suspicious.
	/SwitchTo Casey
	No I haven't, but I think she's lucky she got to die.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	A little morbid, isn't it?
	/SwitchTo Casey
	And?	
	/GiveIdea metCasey
	You sound so lame.
	/Introduced
	Are we done here?

metMaria {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	So Casey, how was your relationship with Maria?
	/SwitchTo Casey
	She was kind of annoying to be honest. I know, she's dead, be nice, blah blah blah. 
	But she was always kind of rude to me. She always said I was sinning and that I was some sort of devil child.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Oh, well I'm sorry to hear that.
	/SwitchTo Casey
	Yeah, it's whatever I guess...

metEddie {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Eddie said that he has been with you all night. Can you confirm that?
	/SwitchTo Casey
	Yeah, basically.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	What do you mean by basically?
	/SwitchTo Casey
	Well he took a while getting food and then he had to use the bathroom, but we've been hanging out basically all night.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Thanks for your help.
	/SwitchTo Casey
	ThAnKs foR yOuR hElp.

necromancyTome {
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	I found this in your room, can you explain it?
	/SwitchTo Casey
	It's an old book that I got as a gift, so what?
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	An old book about necromancy. Do you know how dangerous this is? 
	You could get in serious trouble for practicing this. Who gave this to you anyway?
	/SwitchTo Casey
	Eddie gave it to me for my birthday. Besides, I know what I'm doing.
	/GiveIdea birthdayGift
	Did you come here to lecture me or to investigate a death?

crimsonAccusation {
	/SwitchTo Casey
	You're blaming me because of how I look, right? Typical.
	Get the hell out of here before I tell anyone else.
	/SwitchTo Dresden
	Shit...
