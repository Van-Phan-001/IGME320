	Alright, I’m here. I was given a key to get into the mansion.
	I should press TAB to open up that little mind palace of mine.
	Whenever I get a new clue or idea, it’ll be stored within there, and I can drag ideas over each other to combine them.
	I can also choose a piece of information to hold on to that I can use to interact with the environment.
	/GiveIdea mansionKey
	Well, let’s get going.

	Well, let’s see what this case of ours is about. With any luck I’ll be done in no time.
	/OpenDoor
	Though I have to say, this place doesn’t seem to be too out of the ordinary.
	It looks like there’s a party going on in there. I should probably blend in with the crowd to meet up with all of the residents of the mansion.
