All models found at https://www.mixamo.com/

File names have been changed to match their in-game character name.

When importing models into the scene, models will be completely textureless.
To fix this, go into the inspector and open the Materials tab.
In the Location setting, choose "Use External Materials (Legacy)", then choose "Apply".
If any other screens pop up, choose "Fix now".
The model should now have textures.
